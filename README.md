In the projects for this course, I focused on solving problems that required organizing, searching, and managing data efficiently, rather than just making the program work. The main challenge was choosing and implementing the right data structures to store and manipulate information in a way that balanced performance and clarity. I approached each problem by first breaking it into smaller parts—understanding the input, defining the output, and then deciding which data structure (such as lists, maps, or trees) best fit the task. Learning why data structures matter helped me see how they directly affect speed, memory usage, and how easy a program is to modify later.

When I ran into roadblocks, such as logic errors or difficulty implementing algorithms correctly, I relied on step-by-step debugging, pseudocode, and testing small pieces of functionality before combining them into a full solution. These challenges pushed me to be more patient and methodical in my problem-solving. Overall, this project expanded my approach to software design by teaching me to plan before coding and to think about long-term usability instead of short-term fixes. It also changed how I write programs: I now focus more on clear naming, modular functions, and consistent structure so that my code is readable, maintainable, and adaptable to future changes. Instead of just aiming for a working solution, I aim for one that is efficient, understandable, and easy to extend.
